<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Karen as mentioned before and I have 4 siblings in total and a black pomeranian dog. The major I chose to is psychology
 because I think it's interesting to learn about the mind and the human behavior. I also would like to get my masters in this major to
 become a clinical therapist and help others manage the stress that life can bring. I would also like to major in computer science
 because I think it is important to see more women in stem and I just think it would be great to incoporate psychology and computer science 
 together.

<h3>Favorite hobbies and activites</h3>
<p>
    My favorite hobbies are playing minecraft and reading books. I really like minecraft because I never get bored of it and I could 
    play it for hours, ones I played minecraft for nearly 6 hours straight. The books I like reading are educational books like psychology 
    because it helps me understand the material better and have a change to ask the teacher questions. I like minecraft so much that I have stickers of it all over 
    my laptop. The activites that I like doing is going to the gym, hanging out with
    friends, going on nature walks, going to meseums, and haning out with my siblings.

<h3>Fun Fact</h3>

    A fun fact about myself is my favorite color is pink and I really like strawberry things which can be the smell of artifical strawberries
    or just shirts that have strawberries.
